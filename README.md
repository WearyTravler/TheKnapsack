# TheKnapsack
This is a collection of scripts, tools, and customized tools that I've created or collected, Enjoy.


### Goals
* Simply to store one-off scripts that I found encouraging for myself to create, to learn to use in a particular language but doesn't require an entire repo to manage or contain in.

* I'll constantly be updating the structure of this repo to help benefit others and myself to finding the right tool or script for the job.

* I'll definitely link the original place I found the idea for the tool or how I came about wanting to create this tool or customization for an existing tool.
